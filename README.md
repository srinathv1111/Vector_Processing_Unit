# ‚öôÔ∏è Vector Processing Unit (VPU) with RISC-V Integration

This repository contains the **design and integration of a Vector Processing Unit (VPU)** with a **basic RISC-V processor**, written in **Verilog**. The project demonstrates parallel vector computation using a custom vector ALU and load/store architecture, enabling high-throughput operations suitable for scientific computing and signal processing applications.

## üìå Project Overview

- üöÄ **Parallel Execution** of vector operations (Add, Sub, Mul) using 8-lane Vector ALU
- üì• **Vector Load/Store Unit (VLS)** to handle memory interactions
- üß† **Vector Register Bank** with 8 registers, each holding 8 elements
- üß© **Integrated with RISC-V** single-cycle processor

## üéØ Project Objective

Design a **Vector Processing Unit (VPU)** capable of:

- Handling element-wise vector operations in parallel
- Supporting vector length up to 8
- Enabling masked operations via VMR
- Interfacing with a RISC-V core and memory system
- Demonstrating significant performance gain over scalar execution

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

- **Vector Register Bank (VRB):** 8 registers √ó 8 elements
- **Vector ALU:** 8 parallel ALU instances (Add/Sub/Mul)
- **Vector Load Store Unit (VLS):** FSM-controlled memory interface
- **Control Unit:** Handles standard and vector instructions (opcode = `1111111`)
- **Memory-mapped I/O:** For loading vectors and executing operations

## Vector vs Scalar Execution

- The above scalar code would take almost 600+ instructions to execute whereas if we vectorize it, it would take just 5 instructions to finish the program
- With deep pipelining and parallel computing by using multiple ALUs, Vector execution would be consuming very less clock cycles compared to scalar execution

## VPU Architecture
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/39a34ba2-cd96-48fe-9482-9d554302546a)

- üèó **VMIPS-based VPU design**: Modeled the VPU architecture with design cues from the VMIPS vector processor.
- üì• **Load/Store Unit**: Capable of fetching one 32-bit element at a time from memory and delivering it to the vector register bank.
- üß† **Vector Register Bank**: 8 vector registers √ó 8 elements, supporting **16 read ports** and **8 write ports** for true parallelism.
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Vector ALU (VALU)**: Built using **8 parallel ALUs** for performing element-wise Add, Sub, and Mul operations simultaneously.
- üîÄ **Vector Write Data MUX**: Selects data between Load/Store Unit and VALU for writeback into the register bank.
- üìè **Vector size is fixed at 8 elements** for simplicity.
- üßæ **VLR and VMR Registers**: 
  - Register `x31` used as **Vector Length Register (VLR)**.
  - Register `x30` used as **Vector Mask Register (VMR)**.
- üß© **Integrated with RISC-V Core**: The VPU is fully connected with a RISC-V processor, allowing vector instructions to be fetched and executed through a unified instruction memory.
